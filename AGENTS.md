# Agent Guidelines

- Always work from the fork at https://github.com/a5af/waveterm.
- Push branches only to the fork; never push directly to https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm.
- Open pull requests against the fork (5af/waveterm) unless specifically instructed otherwise.
- If upstream changes are needed, coordinate with the maintainer before proposing anything on wavetermdev/waveterm.
