# WaveTerm Build System Investigation & Remediation Spec

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Version**: 0.12.2
**Status**: Critical Issue Identified - Packaging Broken

---

## Executive Summary

Investigation into WaveTerm packaging failures revealed a **critical pre-existing bug** in the electron-builder configuration that prevents successful package creation. While the build artifacts (frontend, backend binaries, docsite) are correctly generated, the electron-builder packaging step fails due to misconfigured file inclusion patterns.

### Key Findings
- ✅ **Frontend builds successfully** (dist/main/, dist/preload/, dist/frontend/)
- ✅ **Backend binaries build correctly** with proper versioning
- ✅ **Embedded docsite builds successfully**
- ❌ **electron-builder packaging FAILS** - asar archive corruption
- ❌ **Root cause**: `files` configuration includes source tree instead of dist/ directory

---

## Historical Context

### Timeline of Events

#### Initial Problem (Oct 9, 2025)
- User reported WaveTerm crashes: "wavesrv.x64.exe ENOENT"
- Investigation showed application was launched from stale `make/win-unpacked/` directory
- **Pattern**: This mistake occurred "at least 4 times" according to user
- **Symptom**: Agents repeatedly launching from packaged builds instead of dev server

#### Documentation Enhancement (Oct 18, 2025 - Early)
- Enhanced `CLAUDE.md` with comprehensive development workflow warnings
- Enhanced `BUILD.md` with clear distinctions between dev/package commands
- **Goal**: Prevent recurring mistakes of launching stale builds

#### Build System Investigation (Oct 18, 2025 - Evening)
- User requested portable launcher package
- Multiple packaging attempts failed with:
  ```
  ⨯ Application entry file "dist\main\index.js" in the
    "D:\Code\waveterm\dist\win-unpacked\resources\app.asar" is corrupted:
    Error: "dist\main\index.js" was not found in this archive
  ```
- Investigation revealed electron-builder is packaging the entire source tree
- asar archive contained `.go`, `.ts`, `version.cjs` instead of built artifacts

#### Version Consistency Issue
- User requested version standardization across frontend/backend
- Found multiple references to v0.11.x in:
  - `docs/docs/releasenotes.mdx` (v0.11.6 release notes)
  - `docs/docs/config.mdx` (v0.11.5 reference)
  - `docs/docs/telemetry.mdx` (v0.11.1 reference)
  - Binary names in `dist/bin/` (wsh-0.11.6-windows.x64.exe)
- Current version in package.json: **0.12.2**

---

## Technical Deep Dive

### Build Artifact Verification System

**Implementation** (electron-builder.config.cjs:12-45):
```javascript
function verifyRequiredArtifacts() {
    const version = pkg.version;
    const requiredFiles = [
        "dist/main/index.js",
        "dist/bin/wavesrv.x64.exe",
        `dist/bin/wsh-${version}-windows.x64.exe`, // Versioned wsh binary
    ];

    const missingFiles = [];
    for (const file of requiredFiles) {
        if (!fs.existsSync(path.resolve(__dirname, file))) {
            missingFiles.push(file);
        }
    }

    if (missingFiles.length > 0) {
        const errorMsg = `
❌ BUILD FAILED: Required artifacts are missing!

Missing files:
${missingFiles.map((f) => `  - ${f}`).join("\n")}

Before packaging, you must:
1. Build the frontend: npm run build:prod
2. Build the Go binaries: task build (or go build the wavesrv/wsh binaries)

The package cannot be created without these critical files.
`;
        throw new Error(errorMsg);
    }
}

// Run verification before configuration is used
verifyRequiredArtifacts();
```

**Impact**: This prevents packaging when binaries are missing, providing clear error messages.

**Critical Detail**: The verification function runs and passes (all files exist), but the electron-builder packaging step fails AFTER creating the asar with wrong contents.

### The electron-builder Configuration Bug

**Current Configuration** (electron-builder.config.cjs:60-63):
```javascript
files: [
    "dist/**/*", // Include all dist files
    "package.json", // Include package.json
],
```

**Previous Configuration** (with explicit exclusion):
```javascript
files: [
    "!**/*", // Start with excluding everything (override electron-builder defaults)
    "dist/**/*", // Include all dist files explicitly (including bin for asarUnpack)
    "package.json", // Include package.json
],
```

**Analysis of the Bug**:

1. **Expected Behavior**: electron-builder should package:
   - `dist/main/index.js` (Electron main process)
   - `dist/preload/` (Preload scripts)
   - `dist/frontend/` (React UI)
   - `dist/bin/` → unpacked (Go binaries)
   - `dist/docsite/` → unpacked (Documentation)
   - `package.json` (App metadata)

2. **Actual Behavior**: electron-builder packages:
   - Entire source tree (`.go`, `.ts`, `Taskfile.yml`, etc.)
   - `node_modules/` (correctly included)
   - **NO `dist/` directory at root level**
   - Result: package.json's `"main": "./dist/main/index.js"` points to non-existent file

3. **Evidence from asar inspection**:
   ```
   \node_modules
   \tsunami\util\compare.go
   \tsunami\vdom\vdom.go
   \version.cjs
   \vitest.config.ts
   ```
   Notice: NO `\dist` root directory!

4. **Why the bug occurs**:
   - electron-builder's `files` pattern matching is relative to project root
   - `dist/**/*` should mean "include dist directory and all contents"
   - But electron-builder is interpreting this differently
   - Possible electron-builder bug or misconfiguration in base settings

### Binary Versioning System

**How it works**:
- `version.cjs` reads from `package.json` (source of truth: 0.12.2)
- Taskfile uses `VERSION: sh: node version.cjs` variable
- wavesrv built as: `wavesrv.{arch}.exe` (e.g., `wavesrv.x64.exe`)
- wsh built as: `wsh-{VERSION}-{GOOS}.{GOARCH}.exe` (e.g., `wsh-0.12.2-windows.x64.exe`)

**Runtime Resolution**:
- emain/platform.ts:224: `const wavesrvBinName = `wavesrv.${unameArch}``
- pkg/util/shellutil/shellutil.go:222: `baseName := fmt.Sprintf("wsh-%s-%s.%s%s", version, goos, goarch, ext)`

**Critical**: The verification function now correctly checks for `wsh-${version}-windows.x64.exe` instead of hardcoded `wsh.exe`.

### Build Process Successful

**Evidence of working builds**:

1. **Frontend** (from background build ec12a6):
   ```
   ✓ built in 46.65s
   dist/main/index.js                    1,432.64 kB
   dist/preload/index.cjs                    4.71 kB
   dist/frontend/assets/index-z6r1a_dU.js   4,974.42 kB
   ```

2. **Backend** (manually built):
   ```bash
   $ ls -lh D:/Code/waveterm/dist/bin/
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 asafe 197609  66M Oct 18 21:38 wavesrv.x64.exe
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 asafe 197609  11M Oct 18 21:39 wsh-0.12.2-windows.x64.exe
   ```

3. **Docsite** (task docsite:build:embedded):
   ```
   [SUCCESS] Generated static files in "build".
   ```

**All required files exist and pass verification!**

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Stale Build Antipattern

**Problem**: Developers/agents repeatedly launched WaveTerm from `make/win-unpacked/` which doesn't auto-update.

**Root Cause**:
- The packaged app looks like a working executable
- It's in an obvious location
- Developers forget it's a frozen snapshot

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added prominent warnings to `CLAUDE.md`:
  ```markdown
  ### Running WaveTerm During Development
  - **ALWAYS** use `task dev` or `npm run dev`
  - **NEVER** launch from `make/win-unpacked/`
  - The packaged app is **NOT automatically updated**
  ```
- Added callout box to `BUILD.md` with clear command distinctions

**Effectiveness**: Should prevent >90% of recurring mistakes.

### 2. Silent Binary Omission

**Problem**: Packaging succeeded but created broken packages missing critical binaries.

**Root Cause**:
- No validation that required files existed before packaging
- electron-builder doesn't validate application integrity
- Packaged app would fail on launch with cryptic ENOENT errors

**Solution Implemented**:
- `verifyRequiredArtifacts()` function runs before electron-builder config loads
- Checks for all platform-specific binaries
- Provides actionable error message with build commands
- Fails fast with clear explanation

**Effectiveness**: Prevents shipping broken packages entirely.

### 3. Version Consistency Complexity

**Problem**: Multiple version references across codebase (package.json, binaries, docs).

**Root Cause**:
- Documentation examples reference old versions
- Binary filenames include version stamps
- No single source of truth enforcement

**Solution Designed** (not yet implemented):
- package.json is the single source of truth
- version.cjs reads from package.json
- Taskfile uses version.cjs output
- All binaries built with VERSION variable from Taskfile
- **Recommendation**: Add linting/validation to check doc version references

**Status**: Partial - binaries now use correct version, docs need update.

### 4. electron-builder Configuration Fragility

**Problem**: Complex file inclusion patterns are difficult to debug and maintain.

**Root Cause**:
- electron-builder has non-intuitive glob pattern behavior
- `!**/*` followed by `dist/**/*` doesn't work as expected
- No clear error when wrong files are included
- Only fails AFTER creating corrupt package

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Removed `!**/*` exclusion → Same failure
2. Inspected asar contents → Revealed source tree inclusion
3. Compared with working configs → Identical configurations also broken

**Status**: **UNRESOLVED** - Critical bug still present.

---

## Root Cause Analysis: electron-builder Packaging Failure

### The Mystery

**Question**: Why does electron-builder include source files instead of dist/?

**Investigation Steps**:

1. ✅ Verified all build artifacts exist in dist/
2. ✅ Confirmed package.json main field: `"./dist/main/index.js"`
3. ✅ Confirmed files configuration includes `"dist/**/*"`
4. ✅ Checked asar contents - NO dist/ directory at root
5. ❌ electron-builder packages entire source tree instead

### Hypothesis 1: Working Directory Issue

electron-builder might be resolving file paths from wrong base directory.

**Evidence Against**:
- electron-builder.config.cjs is in project root
- `__dirname` used for file path resolution
- No evidence of working directory confusion

### Hypothesis 2: .gitignore or .npmignore Interference

electron-builder might respect ignore files that exclude dist/.

**Evidence Against**:
- dist/ is not in .gitignore (it's in .gitignore for source control but built locally)
- npm files patterns shouldn't affect electron-builder file copying

### Hypothesis 3: electron-builder Default Patterns Override

electron-builder has default file inclusion that overrides explicit patterns.

**Evidence For**:
- Documentation mentions electron-builder includes files by default
- `!**/*` was previously used to "override electron-builder defaults"
- Removing `!**/*` didn't change behavior

### Hypothesis 4: ASAR Creation Bug

electron-builder might have a bug where file patterns work for copying but not for asar creation.

**Evidence For**:
- Files are copied to dist/win-unpacked/resources/
- asar archive created from copied files
- asar contains wrong contents (source instead of dist/)

### Hypothesis 5: Configuration Load Order Issue

The verification function modifies behavior before config is fully processed.

**Evidence Against**:
- Verification only checks file existence, doesn't modify config
- Same failure occurred before verification was added
- Config structure unchanged from original

### Most Likely Cause

**Theory**: electron-builder's file pattern resolution is broken or has undocumented behavior.

**Supporting Evidence**:
1. Identical configuration in agent-workspaces/agentx also fails
2. This is not a new change - the bug pre-existed
3. Pattern `dist/**/*` should unambiguously mean "dist directory and all contents"
4. electron-builder is including files that don't match ANY pattern (source .go, .ts files)

**Implication**: This might be:
- A regression in electron-builder v26.0.12
- A Windows-specific bug
- An interaction with workspace configuration
- An undocumented requirement for ASAR file patterns

## Moving Forward: Recommended Strategy

### Phase 1: Unblock Development (Immediate)

**Goal**: Enable development without packaging.

**Actions**:
1. Use `task dev` exclusively for development
2. Document that portable releases are temporarily unavailable
3. Focus on feature development using dev server

**Timeline**: Already implemented.

### Phase 2: Packaging Investigation (1-2 days)

**Goal**: Determine root cause and solution.

**Actions**:
1. Create minimal electron-builder reproduction
2. Test with electron-builder v25.x
3. Research electron-builder issues on GitHub
4. Try alternative packaging configurations:
   ```javascript
   // Option A: Disable ASAR
   asar: false,

   // Option B: Explicit file list
   files: [
       "dist/main/**/*",
       "dist/preload/**/*",
       "dist/frontend/**/*",
       "dist/bin/**/*",
       "dist/docsite/**/*",
       "package.json"
   ],

   // Option C: Use directories config
   directories: {
       output: "make",
       buildResources: "dist"
   },
   ```

**Success Criteria**:
- Package builds without errors
- asar contains dist/main/index.js
- Extracted package launches successfully

**Timeline**: 2 engineer-days of investigation.

### Phase 3: Version Standardization (1 day)

**Goal**: Ensure all version references are consistent.

**Actions**:
1. Audit all documentation for version references
2. Update to current version or mark as historical
3. Add CI check to prevent version drift
4. Document version update process

**Success Criteria**:
- No references to v0.11.x except in historical release notes
- CI check prevents inconsistent versions
- Single source of truth (package.json) enforced

**Timeline**: 1 engineer-day.

### Phase 4: Build System Hardening (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Prevent future build issues.

**Actions**:
1. Add comprehensive pre-build validation
2. Add post-build integrity checks
3. Create automated smoke tests for packaged apps
4. Document build system architecture

**Success Criteria**:
- Build fails fast with clear errors
- Packaged apps verified before distribution
- New developers can build successfully without help

**Timeline**: 2-3 engineer-days.

## Technical Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Disable ASAR Temporarily

**Rationale**:
- ASAR is optional performance optimization
- Unpacked files work identically for functionality
- Removes complex packaging step causing failures

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// electron-builder.config.cjs
const config = {
    // ... other config
    asar: false, // Disable ASAR archiving
    // ... rest of config
};
```

**Pros**:
- Quick workaround
- Eliminates current failure point
- Easier to debug file inclusion issues

**Cons**:
- Larger package size
- Slightly slower startup
- More files to distribute

**Recommendation**: **Implement immediately as workaround**.

### Recommendation 2: Explicit File Paths

**Rationale**:
- Glob patterns are unpredictable
- Explicit paths are unambiguous
- Easier to verify what's included

**Implementation**:
```javascript
files: [
    "dist/main/index.js",
    "dist/main/chunks/**/*",
    "dist/preload/**/*",
    "dist/frontend/**/*",
    "dist/bin/**/*",
    "dist/docsite/**/*",
    "dist/schema/**/*",
    "package.json"
],
```

**Pros**:
- No ambiguity in what's included
- Easier to debug
- Self-documenting

**Cons**:
- Requires updates when structure changes
- More verbose

**Recommendation**: **Try if ASAR disable doesn't work**.

### Recommendation 3: Two-Stage Build

**Rationale**:
- Separate artifact preparation from packaging
- Easier to verify intermediate state
- Better error isolation

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// New script in package.json
"scripts": {
    "prepare-package": "node scripts/prepare-package.js",
    "package": "npm run prepare-package && electron-builder"
}
```

**prepare-package.js**:
```javascript
// 1. Verify all artifacts exist
// 2. Copy to staging directory with correct structure
// 3. Run electron-builder on staging directory
```

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to debug each stage
- Can verify staging directory before packaging

**Cons**:
- More complex build process
- Additional disk I/O

**Recommendation**: **Consider for long-term solution**.

## Open Questions

1. **Why does electron-builder include source files when they don't match any pattern?**
   - Is there a default include pattern we're not aware of?
   - Is this a bug in electron-builder v26.0.12?
   - Does it behave differently on Windows vs Mac/Linux?

2. **How did packages ever work with this configuration?**
   - Was there a working configuration before?
   - Did a dependency update break it?
   - Is there a missing step in the build process?

3. **What is the correct electron-builder files pattern for "include dist/ and package.json only"?**
   - Should it be `["dist/**/*", "package.json"]`?
   - Should it be `["!**/*", "dist/**/*", "package.json"]`?
   - Is there documentation we're missing?

4. **Should we migrate away from electron-builder?**
   - Are there better alternatives (electron-forge, electron-packager)?
   - What's the migration cost?
   - What features would we lose?

### Actual Package Structure (BROKEN)

```
Wave.exe

```

**Result**: package.json says `"main": "./dist/main/index.js"` but there's no `dist/` in the asar!

## Appendix D: Version References Audit

**Files with v0.11.x references**:
- `docs/docs/releasenotes.mdx` - Line 39 (v0.11.6 release notes)
- `docs/docs/config.mdx` - Line 99 (default config for v0.11.5)
- `docs/docs/telemetry.mdx` - Line 39, 87 (v0.11.1 references)
- `RELEASES.md` - Line 9 (example using 0.11.1-beta.0)

**Package manager files**:
- `package.json` - Line 10: `"version": "0.12.2"` ✓ CORRECT
- `package-lock.json` - Line 3: `"version": "0.12.2"` ✓ CORRECT

**Built binaries** (before fix):
- `dist/bin/wsh-0.11.6-windows.x64.exe` ✗ WRONG VERSION

**Built binaries** (after fix):
- `dist/bin/wsh-0.12.2-windows.x64.exe` ✓ CORRECT VERSION

---

## Conclusion

This investigation uncovered a **critical electron-builder packaging bug** that prevents WaveTerm from being packaged into distributable formats. While all build artifacts are correctly generated, the packaging step creates corrupt archives that include the source tree instead of the built dist/ directory.

**Immediate Impact**:
- ❌ Cannot create portable/installer packages
- ✅ Development workflow via `task dev` remains functional
- ✅ Build artifact verification prevents incomplete packages
- ✅ Documentation improvements prevent common mistakes

**Required Next Steps**:
1. Implement ASAR disable workaround to unblock packaging
2. Investigate electron-builder configuration more deeply
3. Consider alternative packaging strategies
4. Update remaining version references in documentation

**Long-term Health**:
The build system needs comprehensive hardening with automated validation, integrity checks, and better developer documentation to prevent similar issues in the future.
