# Wave Terminal - Enhanced Fork

[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fwavetermdev%2Fwaveterm?ref=badge_shield)

> **🔱 This is an open fork of [Wave Terminal](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm) with enhanced multi-instance support and improved user experience features.**

> **Upstream:** [wavetermdev/waveterm](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm) | **Fork:** [a5af/waveterm](https://github.com/a5af/waveterm)

Wave is an open-source terminal that combines traditional terminal features with graphical capabilities like file previews, web browsing, and AI assistance. It runs on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

## 🎯 Fork-Specific Features

This fork includes the following enhancements over the upstream Wave Terminal:

### **Multi-Instance Support (Default)**
- **Multiple Wave instances run by default** - no flags needed!
- Each instance automatically gets its own isolated data directory and database
- Shared configuration settings across instances
- Usage examples:
  ```bash
  Wave.exe                        # Auto multi-instance with generated ID
  Wave.exe --instance=test        # Named multi-instance (waveterm-test data directory)
  Wave.exe --instance=v0.12.2     # Named multi-instance (waveterm-v0.12.2 data directory)
  Wave.exe --single-instance      # Enforce only one instance (traditional mode)
  ```

### **Enhanced Instance Management**
- **Multi-instance by default** - launch multiple Wave windows instantly without configuration
- **Optional single-instance mode** - use `--single-instance` flag to enforce one instance only
- **Informative modal dialogs** explaining instance management with clear usage examples
- Prevents silent failures and accidental instance conflicts
- "Learn More" button with direct link to documentation

### **Improved Lock System**
- Robust file lock implementation prevents data corruption
- Separate lock files for each instance (`wave.lock`)
- SQLite database isolation (no WAL file conflicts)
- Graceful error handling with helpful user feedback

### **Better Documentation**
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation for multi-instance architecture
- Clear path isolation examples
- Usage patterns and best practices

## 🔄 Version Management (For Developers & Agents)

### Quick Version Bump

This fork uses automated version bumping across all configs and docs:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
./bump-version.ps1 patch                              # 0.12.3 -> 0.12.4
./bump-version.ps1 minor -Agent agent2                # 0.12.3 -> 0.13.0
./bump-version.ps1 0.12.10 -Message "Add new feature" # Set specific version
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
./bump-version.sh patch                               # 0.12.3 -> 0.12.4
./bump-version.sh minor --agent agent2                # 0.12.3 -> 0.13.0
./bump-version.sh 0.12.10 --message "Add new feature" # Set specific version
```

The script automatically updates:
- ✅ `package.json` - Main version source
- ✅ `package-lock.json` - Locked dependencies
- ✅ `VERSION_HISTORY.md` - Fork version tracking
- ✅ Git commit with version bump message
- ✅ Git tag (e.g., `v0.12.4-fork`)

### Understanding Fork vs Upstream

- **Upstream:** Original [wavetermdev/waveterm](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm) repo (currently v0.12.0)
- **Fork:** This enhanced [a5af/waveterm](https://github.com/a5af/waveterm) repo (currently v0.12.3-fork)
- **Version History:** See [VERSION_HISTORY.md](./VERSION_HISTORY.md) for complete fork changelog

### For New Agents

Always check [VERSION_HISTORY.md](./VERSION_HISTORY.md) first to understand:
- Current fork version
- What features were added in each version
- Which agent worked on what

Modern development involves constantly switching between terminals and browsers - checking documentation, previewing files, monitoring systems, and using AI tools. Wave brings these graphical tools directly into the terminal, letting you control them from the command line. This means you can stay in your terminal workflow while still having access to the visual interfaces you need.

## Key Features

- Flexible drag & drop interface to organize terminal blocks, editors, web browsers, and AI assistants
- Built-in editor for seamlessly editing remote files with syntax highlighting and modern editor features
- Rich file preview system for remote files (markdown, images, video, PDFs, CSVs, directories)
- Integrated AI chat with support for multiple models (OpenAI, Claude, Azure, Perplexity, Ollama)
- Command Blocks for isolating and monitoring individual commands with auto-close options
- One-click remote connections with full terminal and file system access
- Rich customization including tab themes, terminal styles, and background images
- Powerful `wsh` command system for managing your workspace from the CLI and sharing data between terminal sessions
