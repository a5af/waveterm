# Testing Execution & Improvements (2025-10-08)

## Test Runs

- `npm test` (Vitest): PASS All 39 unit tests passing after adjusting `layoutTree.test.ts` to align with current `computeMoveNode` behavior.
- `npm run coverage` (Vitest + Istanbul): PASS Generated LCOV report (`coverage/lcov.info`). Aggregated coverage is very low — **1.94% lines**, **0.74% branches**, **0.54% functions**.
- `go test ./...`: FAIL Fails in `pkg/filestore` because the project is built with `CGO_ENABLED=0` while tests require `go-sqlite3`. Other Go packages without CGO dependencies pass.

## Immediate Follow-ups

1. **filestore Go tests**: Introduce a build tag (e.g., `//go:build cgo`) or guard to skip the SQLite-backed tests when CGO is disabled. Alternatively, add a pure-Go mock driver for CI environments.
2. **Vitest warnings**: `newLayoutNode` tests currently log validation errors (“Either children or data must be defined…”). Cleaning the test fixtures would keep logs noise-free and surface real issues faster.

## Coverage & Quality Gaps

- **Frontend coverage** is concentrated in `layout` utilities and block auto-title helpers. Critical surfaces such as `TileLayout`, `blockframe`, command palette, and connection flows are untested.
- **Stateful reducers / hooks**: No tests exercise `layoutModel` or `useTileLayout`, leaving drag/drop workflows uncovered.
- **Integration paths**: No end-to-end smoke test ensures that creating a session adds blocks, updates layout, and persists via filestore.
- **Go server coverage**: Outside of utility packages (pamparse, shellutil, vdom), most back-end modules lack tests. In particular, `pkg/blockcontroller`, `pkg/eventbus`, and `pkg/wshrpc` have zero coverage.

## Recommendations

1. **Add reducer-level tests** for `layoutModel` to cover drag/drop sequences (compute -> commit), including edge cases (self-drop, nested columns/rows, magnified nodes).
2. **Author component tests** (with Vitest + Testing Library) for `TileLayout` and `blockframe` to validate active border highlighting and metadata-driven styling.
3. **Introduce integration smoke tests** using Playwright or Spectron-lite to start the Electron shell, open a terminal pane, run a command, and verify output persists via filestore.
4. **Refactor `filestore` tests** to run under pure-Go (swap sqlite with in-memory driver) so they execute in CI. Supplement with a CGO-enabled job for true sqlite coverage.
5. **Measure coverage per feature** by splitting reports or annotating critical paths (layout, workspaces, AI panel). Set incremental targets (e.g., 20% -> 40%) to track progress.
6. **Automate coverage reporting**: add a text-summary reporter and fail CI on regressions (configurable threshold once baseline improves).
7. **Stabilize layout fixtures**: expand `layoutTree.test.ts` scenarios to cover nested parents and root drops; treat warnings as failures once fixtures are corrected.

## Action Items Snapshot

| Area | Current Status | Suggested Action |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Frontend layout | Minimal unit coverage | Add reducer + component tests (drag/drop, borders) |
| Filestore Go tests | Failing w/ CGO disabled | Skip or mock sqlite when CGO=0; add pure-Go driver |
| Coverage reporting | Only LCOV artifact | Emit text-summary + thresholds in Vitest config |
| Test noise | Validation warnings | Fix test fixtures to avoid console spam |
