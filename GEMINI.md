# Gemini Agent Notes

- Gemini must commit and push only to the fork at https://github.com/a5af/waveterm.
- Open pull requests against the fork (5af/waveterm); do not target wavetermdev/waveterm directly.
- If upstream coordination is required, escalate to the maintainer before creating any upstream PRs.
