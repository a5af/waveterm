## Conflict Risk Assessment

### High Risk
**Layout System:**
- Fork has horizontal widget bar modifications
- Upstream has continued layout evolution
- Risk: Medium-High (depends on Agent1's merge quality)
- Files: frontend/layout/, frontend/app/view/

**Block Management:**
- Fork has pane title labels
- Upstream has block system improvements
- Risk: Medium
- Files: frontend/app/block/

### Medium Risk
**AI Panel Integration:**
- Fork predates most AI features
- Upstream has massive AI panel changes
- Risk: Low (clean integration expected)
- Files: frontend/app/aipanel/

### Low Risk
**Dependencies:**
- Both fork and upstream update deps
- Risk: Low (standard npm resolution)
- Files: package.json, go.mod

**Documentation:**
- Fork has custom docs (AGENTS.md, etc.)
- Upstream removes some docs
- Risk: Low (keep fork docs)
- Files: *.md

## Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Created backup branch: backup-pre-v0.12-merge
- [x] Tagged current state: fork-v0.11.6-pre-v0.12-merge
- [x] Created merge branch: agentx/merge-upstream-v0.12.0
- [x] Analyzed fork features (horizontal widget bar, pane title labels)
- [x] Documented current state

### Phase 2: NEXT - Merge Upstream
1. Attempt merge: `git merge upstream/main`
2. Document conflicts
3. Resolve conflicts systematically
4. Test build after conflict resolution

### Phase 3: Validate Fork Features
1. Verify horizontal widget bar still works
2. Verify pane title labels still work
3. Test all AI features
4. Run full test suite

### Phase 4-7: As needed based on Phase 2-3 results

## Critical Files to Watch

**Fork Features:**
- frontend/layout/ (horizontal widget bar)
- frontend/app/block/ (pane title labels)
- PANE_TITLE_LABELS_FEATURE_SPEC.md (fork doc)

## Rollback Plan

If merge fails catastrophically:
```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard fork-v0.11.6-pre-v0.12-merge
git push origin main --force  # ONLY if coordinated with team
```

Or use backup branch:
```bash
git checkout backup-pre-v0.12-merge
git branch -D agentx/merge-upstream-v0.12.0
```

---

## Next Actions

1. Execute `git merge upstream/main`
2. Document conflicts in MERGE_CONFLICTS.md
3. Resolve conflicts file by file
4. Test incrementally after each resolution
5. Create detailed commit message
6. Push to fork for review
